My name is Dáre Soniran, I am a data scientist, open source activist and mental health advocate.

Before career switching, I was a charity finance and operations specialist working with Microsoft Excel, Salesforce Lightning and Tableau. In June 2020, I had time to reflect and began to self-learn SQL. I enrolled in a Data Analyst apprenticeship and complete a Data Science bootcamp.

My skills are still growing but my passion keeps me motivated!

I have experience with python, SQL, Tableau.
